```

**The Process:**
1. **Tokenize** text using GPT-2's tokenizer
2. **Embed** tokens and add position information
3. **Transform** through multiple attention layers
4. **Generate** next token predictions
5. **Sample** from predictions to create new text

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended) ☁️
Click the badge above → Run all cells → Start generating text!

### Option 2: Local Setup 💻
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Yashjain0099/Small_Language_Model_from_Scratch.git
cd Small_Language_Model_from_Scratch

# Install dependencies  
pip install torch tiktoken numpy matplotlib tqdm

# Run the notebook
jupyter notebook SLM_\(scratch\).ipynb
```

---

## 💻 Usage Examples

### 🎯 Basic Text Generation
```python
# Load your trained model
model = SmallLanguageModel()
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pth'))

# Generate text
prompt = "A little girl went to the woods"
output = model.generate(prompt, max_length=50, temperature=0.8)
print(output)
```

### 🎨 Creative vs Focused Generation
```python
# Creative mode (higher temperature)
creative = model.generate("Once upon a time", temperature=1.2, top_k=50)

# Focused mode (lower temperature)  
focused = model.generate("The capital of France is", temperature=0.3, top_k=10)
```

### 🔧 Training Your Own Model
```python
# Quick training setup
trainer = LanguageModelTrainer(model)
trainer.train(
    data_path="your_text_data.txt",
    batch_size=16,
    learning_rate=3e-4,
    epochs=5
)
```

---

## 📊 Results

### 📝 Sample Generation
**Input:** *"A little girl went to the woods"*

**Output:**
```
A little girl went to the woods and he was looking at the animals and he saw 
a little boy with a big smile on its face. He knew she would never bring 
medicine before. One day, the girl called Jeff went for a walk...
```
